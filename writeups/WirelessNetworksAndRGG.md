## Wireless Networks and RGG:
Xingde Jia

A mobile ad-hoc network is formed by a cluster of mobile stations (transceivers) randomly located within a certain area without the infrastructure of base stations. In a mobile ad-hoc network, two stations can communicate directly with each other if and only if they are within each other’s wireless transmission range.

Routing information in a mobile ad-hoc network has to be localized to adapt quickly to changes of the network such as station movements and to reduce the cost of maintaining a global routing table for all the stations. 

There are phase transition properties one is interested in, like when the graph is connected - what is the probability of achieving a fully connected network at a given density.

Ad-Hoc Networks:

- Decentralized
- No pre existing infrastructure
- self-configuring
- Multi-hop Routing 

Applications (Standardized under IEEE , ZigBee ...)

- Wireless sensor networks: environmental, agricultural, industrial, military monitoring
- Disaster relief solutions
- Building Automation 
- IoT, smart cities

How to model these ad-hoc random networks: 

M. Franceschetti, R. Meester, ”Random networks for communication: from statistical physics to information systems”

**Global quantities**
Interested in full connectivity - can write down explicitly when two nodes are connected; also consider "Cluster Expansions". Full connectivity is $1 - $Probability of isolated node. Can find general formula for full connectivity, depending on boundary components, but limited to convex geometries.

Also interested in $K$-connectivity - Reliability. Network remains fully connected if any $k-1$ nodes are randomly removed - can find probability of network having minimum degree $k$.

**Similar to probability theory**
“A system is said to present quenched disorder when some parameters are random variables which do not
evolve with time - they are quenched or frozen. It is opposite to annealed disorder, where the random
variables are allowed to evolve themselves
