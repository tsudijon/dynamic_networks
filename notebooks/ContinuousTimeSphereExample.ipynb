    "# Continuous Time Sphere Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the example of short-lived temperature sensors on the Earth in continuous time, using a combination of a queueing model and point process. Throughout the setup of the model, fix a time $T;$ for each time $t \\in [0,T]$ the set of sensors $S_t$ at time $t$ is a set of locations on $\\mathbb{S}^2,$ where $|S_t|$ is a random variable, and $S_t(i),$ the location of the $i$th sensor is uniformly sampled from the uniform measure on the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the easiest way to set up the model is via a (FIFO) queueing model, or birth-death process representing the sensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with $L_0$ number of sensors, each sampled uniformly from the sphere. \n",
    "- Sensors are added to the queue every so often, again sampled uniformly from the sphere. \n",
    "- Independently of the creation of new sensors, sensors break down at a perhaps different rate, and leave the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the time between consecutive joining/ exiting of the queue by exponential distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queueing Model Implementation\n",
    "Consider a queueing model whose initial length is $L_0,$ the number of initial sensors we begin with. We assume that the queue processes sensors (physically: sensors break down) in a random time $\\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_1),$ and sensors join the queue with interarrival times distributed according to $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda_2),$ which are independent of the times it takes for the queue to process the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simulate this queue in the following way. For a given fixed time $t \\in [0,T],$ by the memoryless property of exponential distributions, the time until a sensor leaves the queue is still $X_1 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_1)$ and the interarrival time is still distributed according to $X_2 \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_2).$ Now, the time until one of these two actions occurs is a random variable $Z = \\min(X_1,X_2) \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2)$ (which can be checked). Now the probability that a sensor joins the queue first is $\\mathbb{P}(X_1 > X_2) = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2},$ and one minus that for the probability that a sensor breaks and leaves the queue. We can then model the process by waiting $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2)$ amount of time, and with probability $\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2},$ adding a new sensor to the queue, or otherwise removing the oldest sensor from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Network Analysis\n",
    "The continuous time model allows us to subsample as finely as we want. We keep track of the birth/death of the sensors in an interval tree; for any $t \\in [0,T]$ we query the interval tree for the set of points that are present on the sphere at that time, and then create a dynamic network via the delaunay construction, assigining node values via some observation function representing temperature, or another desired quantity, and the edge weights by distance on the sphere."
